										<p class="question">How much money does the program cost?</p>
										<p>Participation in CodeIt is free of charge. We have computers for students to use and will provide catered lunch each day.</p>

										<p class="question">Where should we be dropped off and picked up?</p>
										<p>Students should be dropped off by 10:50am and picked up at 3:00pm. Exact drop-off and pick-up locations will be communicated via email upon acceptance to the program.</p>

										<p class="question">What programming experience do I need to participate?</p>
										<p>Zero! We do not expect you to have any previous programming experience.</p>

										<p class="question">If I have coded before, may I still participate?</p>
										<p>We prioritize students with no prior experience; however, if there are open spots, we welcome you to participate!</p>

										<p class="question">If I am in 9th grade, may I still participate?</p>
										<p>Unfortunately, we will not be accepting applications from 9th grade students. Please check out high school outreach programs <a href="https://swe.mit.edu/outreach/high_school/">here</a>!</p>

										<p class="question">I will not be able to attend all 8 sessions. May I still apply?</p>
										<p>We give heavy preference to girls who can commit to all of our class sessions, but we still encourage you to apply.</p>

											<h3>Mentors</h3>
										</header>

										<p class="question">What exactly do mentors do?</p>
										<p>Mentors support the lead instructor by working with an assigned group of girls throughout the program. Think of it as a cross between being a Camp Counselor and being a Teaching Assistant. Mentors also help lead fun social activities for the girls.</p>

										<p class="question">What is the weekly time commitment?</p>
										<p>The classes run from 11am to 3pm on Saturdays, so you should be available from 10:30am to 3:30pm. You are expected to attend all sessions.</p>

										<p class="question">What is the time commitment outside of weekly sessions?</p>
										<p>Mentor training (exact date TBD) will take place prior to the start of the weekly sessions. During this daylong training, we will teach you more about CodeIt and share tips and tricks on being an effective mentor. We will also have various study breaks and activities so that you can get to know the other CodeIt mentors and exec members.</p>

										<p class="question">What experience do I need?</p>
										<p>Be friendly and fun! You should understand fundamental programming concepts and have taken at least an introductory computer science course (e.g. AP Computer Science, 6.0001/0002). Familiarity with block-based programming (e.g. Scratch, App Inventor) is a plus, but not required. Bonus points if you have experience working with middle school kids.</p>

										<p class="question">Is there an interview?</p>
										<p>After you submit your application, we will contact you to schedule an interview if we think you would be a good fit for our program. We will interview mentor candidates in a group and evaluate your ability to teach and work with others.</p>
